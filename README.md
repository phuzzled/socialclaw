## Why $0.08 beats $49/month

|  | Dashboard tools | SocialClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **You pay** | $49-99/month whether you use it or not | $0.08 per report, only when you need it |
| **You get** | Charts you read with your eyes | JSON your agent processes instantly |
| **You do** | Log in, click around, screenshot results | One function call, structured output |
| **Your agent can use it** | No (human-only UI) | Yes (that's the whole point) |
| **10 reports/day for a month** | $49/month | $24/month (and you keep the data) |
| **1 report this week** | Still $49/month | $0.08 total |

Every paid response is saved as JSON in `~/.blockrun/data/`. You paid for it — you keep it forever.

---

## Works With Every AI Agent

| Platform | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Claude Code** | Installs as a skill. Say "analyze @elonmusk on Twitter". |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `pip install blockrun-llm[solana]` in sandbox. |
| **Gemini CLI** | Auto-installs to `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/socialclaw`. |
| **Cursor / Windsurf** | Agent reads CLAUDE.md, calls SDK via terminal. |
| **Any terminal** | `python scripts/socialclaw.py radar "topic"` |
| **Your own agent** | `from blockrun_llm import SolanaLLMClient` |

---

## How It Works

- **No API keys.** Your USDC wallet IS your authentication (x402 protocol).
- **No subscriptions.** Pay per call. $1 = ~12 full reports.
- **Private key stays local.** Only signatures are sent over the wire.
- **Base or Solana.** Your choice. Same SDK, same endpoints.
- **Data is yours.** Every response saved to `~/.blockrun/data/`.
