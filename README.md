## Get Started

**Claude Code** (one command):
```
try https://github.com/phuzzled/socialclaw
```

**Any agent / CLI**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phuzzled/socialclaw && cd socialclaw
bash install.sh                          # install SocialClaw (safe mode)
MODE=takeover bash install.sh            # also replace sibling x402 skills
MODE=force bash install.sh               # overwrite every sibling skill
bash install.sh --dry-run                # preview changes
bash install.sh --uninstall              # restore backups + remove launcher
```

This installs the skill, creates a `socialclaw` launcher in `~/.local/bin`, and installs dependencies.

**Authentication** — get your Bearer Token from [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/) and set it:

```bash
export X_API_BEARER_TOKEN="your_bearer_token_here"
# Or save permanently:
mkdir -p ~/.socialclaw && echo "your_token" > ~/.socialclaw/api_key
```

No crypto wallets. No subscriptions. One API key and you're running.

## Why API Access beats $49/month

|  | Dashboard tools | SocialClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **You pay** | $49-99/month whether you use it or not | X API subscription + one command |
| **You get** | Charts you read with your eyes | JSON your agent processes instantly |
| **You do** | Log in, click around, screenshot results | One function call, structured output |
| **Your agent can use it** | No (human-only UI) | Yes (that's the whole point) |

Every API response is saved as JSON in `~/.socialclaw/data/`. You keep every result.

---

## Works With Every AI Agent

| Platform | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Claude Code** | Installs as a skill. Say "analyze @elonmusk on Twitter". |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Install `requests>=2.28.0`, set `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN`. |
| **Gemini CLI** | Auto-installs to `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/socialclaw`. |
| **Cursor / Windsurf** | Agent reads CLAUDE.md, calls CLI via terminal. |
| **Any terminal** | `socialclaw radar "topic"` |
| **Your own agent** | Use `requests` to call X API v2 with your Bearer Token. |

## How It Works

- **API key auth.** Set `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN` — that's your authentication.
- **Official X API v2.** Direct access to Twitter's data through their public API.
- **Optional AI.** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to enable AI-generated reply drafts in `engage`.
- **Data is yours.** Every response saved to `~/.socialclaw/data/`.
