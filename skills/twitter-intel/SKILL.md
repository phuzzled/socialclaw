# Twitter Intel

Get real-time X/Twitter intelligence without API keys. Analyze accounts, track trending topics, and monitor keywords with live data from X.

## When to Use This Skill

- Tracking what people are saying about a topic or hashtag
- Monitoring brand mentions or competitor activity
- Researching audience sentiment and trends
- Getting real-time social data for market research
- Finding influencers or key voices on a topic

## What This Skill Does

1. **Account Analysis** (`@username`): Analyzes recent posts, engagement patterns, content style, and audience interactions
2. **User Profile Lookup**: Direct profile data — followers, following, verification status (via AttentionVC, $0.002/user)
3. **Follower/Following Lists**: Get a user's followers or who they follow ($0.05/page, ~200 accounts)
4. **Topic Tracking** (`#topic`): Monitors trending discussions, popular posts, and sentiment around hashtags
5. **Keyword Monitoring** (`"keyword"`): Tracks brand mentions, competitor activity, and industry discussions
6. **Engagement Insights**: Provides metrics on likes, replies, and viral potential

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```
/twitter-intel @elonmusk
```

```
/twitter-intel #AI
```

```
/twitter-intel "artificial intelligence startups"
```

### Natural Language

You can also use natural language:

```
What's @blockrunai posting about lately?
```

```
What's trending about AI agents on X?
```

```
Check Twitter for mentions of "Claude Code"
```

### Advanced Usage

Combine multiple analyses:

```
/twitter-intel @competitor1 @competitor2 - compare their content strategies
```

```
/twitter-intel #Web3 - focus on posts from the last 24 hours with high engagement
```

## Instructions

When a user requests Twitter/X intelligence, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)

If the BlockRun SDK is not installed, install it:

```bash
pip install blockrun-llm
```

### 2. Initialize the Client

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
```

If this is the first time, the client will display a QR code for funding the wallet. The user needs to add USDC on Base network ($1-5 is enough for many queries).

### 3. Execute the Query

**For User Profile Lookup (cheap, direct data via AttentionVC):**

Use these when you need structured profile data, follower counts, or follower/following lists — much cheaper than Grok Live Search.

```python
# Look up profiles ($0.002/user, min $0.02)
users = client.x_user_lookup(["elonmusk", "blockrunai"])
for u in users.users:
    print(f"@{u.userName}: {u.followers} followers, verified={u.isBlueVerified}")

# Get followers ($0.05/page, ~200 accounts)
result = client.x_followers("blockrunai")
for f in result.followers:
    print(f"@{f.screen_name} - {f.description}")

# Paginate through all followers
while result.has_next_page:
    result = client.x_followers("blockrunai", cursor=result.next_cursor)

# Get followings ($0.05/page)
followings = client.x_followings("blockrunai")
```

**For Account Analysis (@username):**

```python
response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    f"Analyze @{username}'s recent X/Twitter activity. Include: recent posts, engagement patterns, content themes, posting frequency, and notable interactions.",
    search_parameters={
        "mode": "on",
        "sources": [
            {
                "type": "x",
                "included_x_handles": [username],
                "post_favorite_count": 5
            }
        ],
        "max_search_results": 15,
        "return_citations": True
    }
)
```

**For Topic/Hashtag Tracking (#topic):**

```python
response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    f"What are people saying about #{topic} on X/Twitter right now? Include: trending discussions, popular posts, key voices, and overall sentiment.",
    search_parameters={
        "mode": "on",
        "sources": [{"type": "x", "post_favorite_count": 50}],
        "max_search_results": 20,
        "return_citations": True
    }
)
```

**For Keyword Monitoring ("keyword"):**

```python
response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    f"Search X/Twitter for mentions of '{keyword}'. Include: recent discussions, sentiment, key influencers mentioning this, and notable posts.",
    search_parameters={
        "mode": "on",
        "sources": [{"type": "x", "post_favorite_count": 10}],
        "max_search_results": 15,
        "return_citations": True
    }
)
```
