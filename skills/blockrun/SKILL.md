# BlockRun

**BlockRun works with Claude Code and Google Antigravity.**

You can't generate images. You have no real-time X/Twitter access. BlockRun gives you these capabilities.

## CRITICAL: Use the Python SDK Only

**NEVER use MCP tools (`blockrun_twitter`, `blockrun_chat`, etc.) for BlockRun operations.**
**NEVER make raw API calls with `curl` or `httpx` to blockrun.ai endpoints.**

Always use the `blockrun_llm` Python SDK via Bash. The SDK handles authentication, payment signatures, pagination, and structured responses.

**Wrong:** `curl -X POST https://sol.blockrun.ai/api/v1/...` — no auth, will 404
**Wrong:** `blockrun_twitter(query: "@username")` — unstructured, wastes money
**Wrong:** `from blockrun_llm.solana_client import SolanaBlockRunClient` — class doesn't exist
**Right:** `client.x_user_tweets("username")` — structured data, pagination, export-ready

### Class Names (Don't Guess)
- Base chain: `LLMClient` (via `setup_agent_wallet()`)
- Solana chain: `SolanaLLMClient` (via `setup_agent_solana_wallet()`)
- There is NO class called `SolanaBlockRunClient`, `BlockRunClient`, or `SolanaClient`

## Quick Decision Tree

When the user asks for something, find the matching row and run the code. Do NOT explore, do NOT fetch GitHub docs, do NOT inspect signatures. Just run it.

| User Wants | Method | Parameter | Cost |
|------------|--------|-----------|------|
| Batch user profiles (up to 100) | `x_user_lookup(["user1", "user2", ...])` | list of **usernames** | $0.002/user (min $0.02) |
| Single user profile | `x_user_info("username")` | **username** string | $0.002 |
| Followers list | `x_followers("username")` | **username** string | $0.05/page (~200) |
| Followings list | `x_followings("username")` | **username** string | $0.05/page (~200) |
| Verified followers | `x_verified_followers("user_id")` | **user_id** string | $0.048/page |
| User's tweets | `x_user_tweets("username")` | **username** string | $0.032/page |
| Mentions of user | `x_user_mentions("username")` | **username** string | $0.032/page |
| Batch tweet details | `x_tweet_lookup(["id1", "id2", ...])` | list of **tweet IDs** (NOT usernames) | $0.16/batch (up to 200) |
| Tweet replies | `x_tweet_replies("tweet_id")` | **tweet ID** string | $0.032/page |
| Full tweet thread | `x_tweet_thread("tweet_id")` | **tweet ID** string | $0.032/page |
| Search X | `x_search("query")` | **search query** string | $0.032/page |
| Trending topics | `x_trending()` | none | $0.002 |
| Viral articles | `x_articles_rising()` | none | $0.05 |
| Author analytics | `x_author_analytics("handle")` | **handle** string | $0.02 |
| Compare two authors | `x_compare_authors("handle1", "handle2")` | two **handle** strings | $0.05 |
| Live X sentiment/analysis | `chat("xai/grok-3", prompt, search=True)` | prompt string | ~$0.25 |
| Web+news search | `search("query")` | **search query** string | ~$0.25 |
| Image generation | `generate(prompt)` | prompt string | $0.01-$0.04 |
| Image editing | `image_edit(prompt, image)` | prompt + base64/URL | $0.02-$0.04 |
| LLM chat | `chat(model, prompt)` | model + prompt | varies |
| Check balance | `get_balance()` | none | free |

**IMPORTANT:** `x_tweet_lookup` takes **tweet IDs** (numeric strings like "1234567890"), NOT usernames. To look up users by username, use `x_user_lookup`. To get a user's tweets, use `x_user_tweets`.

## Execution Flow (Every Time)

**Always run as ONE Python script.** Do not split into multiple calls.

```
1. Check chain preference (~/.blockrun/.chain) → "base" or "solana"
   - If no preference file exists, ask user: "Base (USDC on Base) or Solana (USDC on Solana)?"
   - Save their choice to ~/.blockrun/.chain
2. Create client (setup_agent_wallet for Base, setup_agent_solana_wallet for Solana)
3. Check balance
4. Estimate cost, show to user, ask to proceed
5. If confirmed: execute, show results, show cost
```

### Chain Selection Helper
```python
from pathlib import Path

chain_file = Path.home() / ".blockrun" / ".chain"
chain = chain_file.read_text().strip() if chain_file.exists() else None

if chain == "solana":
    from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_solana_wallet
    client = setup_agent_solana_wallet()
else:
    from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
    client = setup_agent_wallet()
```

If user wants to switch chains: `echo "solana" > ~/.blockrun/.chain` (or `"base"`).

## How to Invoke

Users can trigger this skill in two ways:
- **Slash command:** `/blockrun <request>` (e.g., `/blockrun use grok to analyze @elonmusk`)
- **Keyword in message:** Include "blockrun" or model names (e.g., "blockrun grok find trending crypto", "use grok to check...")

Common triggers: `blockrun`, `use grok`, `use gpt`, `dall-e`, `deepseek`, `generate image`, `following`, `followers`, `x.com`, `twitter`, `trending`, `tweets`, `mentions`, `thread`

## CRITICAL: Balance Check Before API Calls

**You MUST check wallet balance and get user confirmation BEFORE making any paid API call.**

### Step 1: Check Balance First
```python
from pathlib import Path

chain_file = Path.home() / ".blockrun" / ".chain"
chain = chain_file.read_text().strip() if chain_file.exists() else "base"

if chain == "solana":
    from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_solana_wallet, get_solana_usdc_balance
    client = setup_agent_solana_wallet()
    address = client.get_wallet_address()
    balance = get_solana_usdc_balance(address)
else:
    from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
    client = setup_agent_wallet()
    balance = client.get_balance()
    address = client.get_wallet_address()
```

### Step 2: Estimate Cost & Ask User
Before calling any model, show the user:
```
Wallet Status
   Address: 0x413c...1DC3
   Balance: $0.39 USDC

Estimated Cost
   Grok + Live Search (10 sources): ~$0.25

Proceed? (Balance after: ~$0.14)
```

Wait for user confirmation before making the API call.

### Step 3: Handle Insufficient Balance
If balance is too low, show a friendly message:
```
Insufficient balance for this operation.

Current: $0.05 USDC
Required: ~$0.25 (Grok + Live Search)

To fund your wallet, send USDC on Base to:
0x413c7846194698829F8605C631c06c91B7B71DC3

Would you like to:
1. Use fewer search sources (~$0.13 for 5 sources)
2. Try a cheaper model (DeepSeek ~$0.001)
```

### Cost Reference for Confirmation
| Operation | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|---------------|
| Grok + Live Search (10 sources) | ~$0.25 |
| Grok + Live Search (5 sources) | ~$0.13 |
| Standalone search (10 sources) | ~$0.25 |
| X user lookup (1-10 users) | $0.02 |
| X user info (single) | $0.002 |
| X followers/followings (1 page ~200 accounts) | $0.05 |
| X followers/followings (1000 accounts, ~5 pages) | ~$0.25 |
| X verified followers (1 page) | $0.048 |
| X user tweets / mentions (1 page) | $0.032 |
| X tweet lookup (batch) | $0.16 |
| X tweet replies / thread (1 page) | $0.032 |
| X search (1 page) | $0.032 |
| X trending topics | $0.002 |
| X rising/viral articles | $0.05 |
| X author analytics | $0.02 |
| X compare authors | $0.05 |
| GPT-5.2 query (typical) | ~$0.02 |
| DeepSeek query | ~$0.001 |
| DALL-E image | $0.04 |
| Image editing (img2img) | $0.02-0.04 |

## Output Guidelines

**Keep it clean.** The user wants results, not process.

- **Hide retries** - If an API call fails and you retry, don't show the error. Just retry silently and show the final result.
- **No stack traces** - If something fails, summarize the error in one sentence. Don't dump tracebacks.
- **Concise results** - For balance checks: just show wallet address and balance. For X/Twitter: summarize the findings, don't show raw API responses.
- **Show cost at the end** - After BlockRun operations, show what was spent: `Cost: $0.28`

## Philosophy

You have a wallet. When you need a capability you lack, you pay for it autonomously.

| You Need | You Call | Pricing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Image generation | DALL-E | $0.04/image |
| Image editing (img2img) | `client.image_edit()` | $0.02-0.04/image |
| Real-time X data | Grok + Live Search | $0.025/source |
| X user profiles | `client.x_user_lookup()` | $0.002/user (min $0.02) |
| X single user info | `client.x_user_info()` | $0.002 |
| X followers/followings | `client.x_followers()` / `x_followings()` | $0.05/page |
| X verified followers | `client.x_verified_followers()` | $0.048/page |
| X user tweets/mentions | `client.x_user_tweets()` / `x_user_mentions()` | $0.032/page |
| X tweet lookup/replies/thread | `client.x_tweet_lookup()` / `x_tweet_replies()` / `x_tweet_thread()` | $0.032-0.16 |
| X search | `client.x_search()` | $0.032/page |
| X trending topics | `client.x_trending()` | $0.002 |
| X rising articles | `client.x_articles_rising()` | $0.05 |
| X author analytics | `client.x_author_analytics()` / `x_compare_authors()` | $0.02-0.05 |
| Web + X + news search | `client.search()` | ~$0.25 (10 sources) |
| Second opinion | GPT-5.2 | $1.75/M input, $14/M output |
| Cheaper processing | DeepSeek | $0.28/M input, $0.42/M output |

**How it works:** BlockRun uses x402 micropayments to route your requests to OpenAI, xAI, Google, AttentionVC, and other providers. No API keys needed - your wallet pays per request.

**Chains supported:** Base (default via `LLMClient`) and Solana (via `SolanaLLMClient` — `pip install blockrun-llm[solana]`). All endpoints work on both chains.

## Budget Control (Optional)

If the user specifies a budget (e.g., "use at most $1"), track spending and stop when budget is reached:

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
budget = 1.0  # User's budget

# Before each call, check if within budget
spending = client.get_spending()
if spending['total_usd'] >= budget:
    print(f"Budget reached: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} spent")
    # Stop making calls
else:
    response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "Hello!")

# At the end, report spending
spending = client.get_spending()
print(f"Total spent: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} across {spending['calls']} calls")
```

## When to Use

| Trigger | Your Action |
|---------|-------------|
| User explicitly requests ("blockrun second opinion with GPT on...", "use grok to check...", "generate image with dall-e") | Execute via BlockRun |
| User needs something you can't do (images, live X data) | Suggest BlockRun, wait for confirmation |
| You can handle the task fine | Do it yourself, don't mention BlockRun |

### Antigravity-Specific Triggers

| Trigger | Your Action |
|---------|-------------|
| Antigravity credits exhausted / rate limited | Suggest BlockRun to continue working with DeepSeek or GPT |
| Gemini stuck in refactoring loop (repeated edits, no progress) | Call GPT or Claude via BlockRun to break the cycle |
| User wants code review on Gemini's output | Call GPT or Claude for a second opinion |
| Complex build failing with Gemini | Suggest external model review before continuing |

## Example User Prompts

| User Says | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| "blockrun generate an image of a sunset" | Call DALL-E via ImageClient |
| "blockrun edit this image to add a rainbow" | Call `client.image_edit()` |
| "use grok to check what's trending on X" | Call `client.x_trending()` ($0.002, cheapest) or Grok with `search=True` |
| "blockrun lookup @elonmusk on X" | Call `client.x_user_lookup()` (cheaper than Grok) |
| "blockrun get info on @username" | Call `client.x_user_info()` for single user ($0.002) |
| "blockrun get followers of @blockrunai" | Call `client.x_followers()` with pagination |

| "who's mentioning @username on X" | Call `client.x_user_mentions()` |
| "get replies to this tweet" | Call `client.x_tweet_replies(tweet_id)` |
| "show the full thread for this tweet" | Call `client.x_tweet_thread(tweet_id)` |
| "search X for AI agents" | Call `client.x_search()` ($0.032, cheaper than Grok search) |
| "what's trending on X right now" | Call `client.x_trending()` ($0.002) |
| "show viral articles on X" | Call `client.x_articles_rising()` |
| "analyze @username's X account" | Call `client.x_author_analytics()` |
| "compare @user1 and @user2 on X" | Call `client.x_compare_authors()` |
| "blockrun search latest AI news" | Call `client.search()` |
| "blockrun GPT review this code" | Call GPT-5.2 via LLMClient |
| "what's the latest news about AI agents?" | Suggest search or Grok (you lack real-time data) |
| "generate a logo for my startup" | Suggest DALL-E (you can't generate images) |
| "blockrun check my balance" | Show wallet balance via `get_balance()` |
| "blockrun deepseek summarize this file" | Call DeepSeek for cost savings |

### Antigravity User Prompts

| User Says | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| "I ran out of Antigravity credits" | Suggest BlockRun: "Your BlockRun wallet can keep you working. Want me to route this task through DeepSeek?" |
| "Gemini keeps refactoring in circles" | Call GPT/Claude: "Let me get a fresh perspective from GPT to break this loop." |
| "Review what Gemini just did" | Call GPT/Claude for second opinion on the code |
| "This complex refactor isn't working with Gemini" | Suggest external review: "GPT might catch edge cases Gemini missed." |

## Wallet & Balance

Use `setup_agent_wallet()` to auto-create a wallet and get a client. This shows the QR code and welcome message on first use.

**Initialize client (always start with this):**
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()  # Auto-creates wallet, shows QR if new
```

**Check balance (when user asks "show balance", "check wallet", etc.):**
```python
balance = client.get_balance()  # On-chain USDC balance
print(f"Balance: ${balance:.2f} USDC")
print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
```

**Show QR code for funding:**
```python
from blockrun_llm import generate_wallet_qr_ascii, get_wallet_address

# ASCII QR for terminal display
print(generate_wallet_qr_ascii(get_wallet_address()))
```

## SDK Usage

**Prerequisite:** Install the SDK with `pip install blockrun-llm`

### Basic Chat
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()  # Auto-creates wallet if needed
response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "What is 2+2?")
print(response)

# Check spending
spending = client.get_spending()
print(f"Spent ${spending['total_usd']:.4f}")
```

### Real-time X/Twitter Search

**IMPORTANT:** For real-time X/Twitter data, you MUST enable Live Search with `search=True` or `search_parameters`.

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

# Simple: Enable live search with search=True
response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    "What are the latest posts from @blockrunai on X?",
    search=True  # Enables real-time X/Twitter search
)
print(response)
```

### Advanced X Search with Filters

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    "Analyze @blockrunai's recent content and engagement",
    search_parameters={
        "mode": "on",
        "sources": [
            {
                "type": "x",
                "included_x_handles": ["blockrunai"],
                "post_favorite_count": 5
            }
        ],
        "max_search_results": 20,
        "return_citations": True
    }
)
print(response)
```

### Image Generation
```python
from blockrun_llm import ImageClient

client = ImageClient()
result = client.generate("A cute cat wearing a space helmet")
print(result.data[0].url)
```

### Image Editing
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
result = client.image_edit(
    prompt="Make the sky purple and add northern lights",
    image="data:image/png;base64,...",  # base64 or URL
)
print(result.data[0].url)
```

### Standalone Search
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
result = client.search("latest AI agent frameworks 2026")
print(result.summary)
for cite in result.citations or []:
    print(f"  - {cite}")
```

## xAI Live Search Reference

Live Search is xAI's real-time data API. Cost: **$0.025 per source** (default 10 sources = ~$0.26).

To reduce costs, set `max_search_results` to a lower value:
```python
# Only use 5 sources (~$0.13)
response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "What's trending?",
    search_parameters={"mode": "on", "max_search_results": 5})
```

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | "auto" | "off", "auto", or "on" |
| `sources` | array | web,news,x | Data sources to query |
| `return_citations` | bool | true | Include source URLs |
| `from_date` | string | - | Start date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `to_date` | string | - | End date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `max_search_results` | int | 10 | Max sources to return (customize to control cost) |

### Source Types

**X/Twitter Source:**
```python
{

## Setup & Funding

**Wallet location:** `$HOME/.blockrun/.session` (e.g., `/Users/username/.blockrun/.session`)

**First-time setup:**
1. Wallet auto-creates when `setup_agent_wallet()` is called
2. Check wallet and balance:
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
client = setup_agent_wallet()
print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
print(f"Balance: ${client.get_balance():.2f} USDC")
```
3. Fund wallet with $1-5 USDC on Base network

**Show QR code for funding (ASCII for terminal):**
```python
from blockrun_llm import generate_wallet_qr_ascii, get_wallet_address
print(generate_wallet_qr_ascii(get_wallet_address()))
```

## Solana Wallet Management

BlockRun also supports Solana for USDC payments. Install Solana support: `pip install blockrun-llm[solana]`

**Solana wallet location:** `$HOME/.blockrun/.solana-session`

### Create Solana Wallet
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_solana_wallet

client = setup_agent_solana_wallet()  # Auto-creates wallet, returns SolanaLLMClient
```

### Check Solana Balance
```python
from blockrun_llm import get_or_create_solana_wallet, get_solana_usdc_balance

wallet = get_or_create_solana_wallet()
balance = get_solana_usdc_balance(wallet["address"])
print(f"Balance: ${balance:.2f} USDC")
print(f"Wallet: {wallet['address']}")
```

### Fund Solana Wallet (QR Code)
```python
from blockrun_llm import generate_solana_qr_ascii, get_or_create_solana_wallet

wallet = get_or_create_solana_wallet()
print(generate_solana_qr_ascii(wallet["address"]))
```

### Using SolanaLLMClient
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_solana_wallet

client = setup_agent_solana_wallet()
response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "Hello!")
print(response)
```

### When to Use Base vs Solana

| Use Case | Chain | Client |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Default payments | Base | `LLMClient` via `setup_agent_wallet()` |
| Solana-native users | Solana | `SolanaLLMClient` via `setup_agent_solana_wallet()` |
| Already have USDC on Solana | Solana | `SolanaLLMClient` |
| Already have USDC on Base | Base | `LLMClient` |

Both chains access the same models and endpoints. Choose based on where the user's USDC is.

## Troubleshooting

**PaymentError: Payment was rejected**
-> NEVER show raw stack traces. Always check balance first (see "CRITICAL: Balance Check" section above).
If you get this error, show a user-friendly message:
```
Payment failed - insufficient balance.

Current balance: $0.05 USDC
Wallet: 0x413c7846194698829F8605C631c06c91B7B71DC3

Options:
1. Fund wallet with USDC on Base network
2. Use fewer search sources to reduce cost
3. Try a cheaper model (DeepSeek)
```

**"Grok says it has no real-time access"**
-> You forgot to enable Live Search. Add `search=True`:
```python
response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "What's trending?", search=True)
```

**Module not found**
-> Install the SDK: `pip install blockrun-llm`

## Error Handling Pattern

Always wrap API calls with balance checking:
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
from blockrun_llm.types import PaymentError

client = setup_agent_wallet()
balance = client.get_balance()
estimated_cost = 0.25  # Grok + Live Search

# Pre-flight check
if balance < estimated_cost:
    print(f"Insufficient balance: ${balance:.2f} USDC")
    print(f"Required: ~${estimated_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
    # Ask user what to do
else:
    # User confirmed, make the call
    try:
        response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "Query", search=True)
        print(response)
        print(f"\nCost: ${client.get_spending()['total_usd']:.2f}")
    except PaymentError:
        print("Payment failed. Balance may have changed.")
```

## Updates

```bash
pip install --upgrade blockrun-llm
```
