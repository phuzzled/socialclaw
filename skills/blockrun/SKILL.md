# BlockRun

**BlockRun works with Claude Code and Google Antigravity.**

You can't generate images. You have no real-time X/Twitter access. BlockRun gives you these capabilities.

## How to Invoke

Users can trigger this skill in two ways:
- **Slash command:** `/blockrun <request>` (e.g., `/blockrun use grok to analyze @elonmusk`)
- **Keyword in message:** Include "blockrun" or model names (e.g., "blockrun grok find trending crypto", "use grok to check...")

Common triggers: `blockrun`, `use grok`, `use gpt`, `dall-e`, `deepseek`, `generate image`

## CRITICAL: Balance Check Before API Calls

**You MUST check wallet balance and get user confirmation BEFORE making any paid API call.**

### Step 1: Check Balance First
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
balance = client.get_balance()
address = client.get_wallet_address()
```

### Step 2: Estimate Cost & Ask User
Before calling any model, show the user:
```
📊 Wallet Status
   Address: 0x413c...1DC3
   Balance: $0.39 USDC

💰 Estimated Cost
   Grok + Live Search (10 sources): ~$0.25

Proceed? (Balance after: ~$0.14)
```

Wait for user confirmation before making the API call.

### Step 3: Handle Insufficient Balance
If balance is too low, show a friendly message:
```
⚠️ Insufficient balance for this operation.

Current: $0.05 USDC
Required: ~$0.25 (Grok + Live Search)

To fund your wallet, send USDC on Base to:
0x413c7846194698829F8605C631c06c91B7B71DC3

Would you like to:
1. Use fewer search sources (~$0.13 for 5 sources)
2. Try a cheaper model (DeepSeek ~$0.001)
```

### Cost Reference for Confirmation
| Operation | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|---------------|
| Grok + Live Search (10 sources) | ~$0.25 |
| Grok + Live Search (5 sources) | ~$0.13 |
| Standalone search (10 sources) | ~$0.25 |
| X user lookup (1-10 users) | $0.02 |
| X followers/followings (1 page) | $0.05 |
| GPT-5.2 query (typical) | ~$0.02 |
| DeepSeek query | ~$0.001 |
| DALL-E image | $0.04 |
| Image editing (img2img) | $0.02-0.04 |

## Output Guidelines

**Keep it clean.** The user wants results, not process.

- **Hide retries** - If an API call fails and you retry, don't show the error. Just retry silently and show the final result.
- **No stack traces** - If something fails, summarize the error in one sentence. Don't dump tracebacks.
- **Concise results** - For balance checks: just show wallet address and balance. For X/Twitter: summarize the findings, don't show raw API responses.
- **Show cost at the end** - After BlockRun operations, show what was spent: `Cost: $0.28`

**Example good output:**
```
@BlockRunAI Twitter Summary:
- Recent focus: Circle partnership, Grok integration, website redesign
- Top post: Circle announcement (1,637 views, 26 likes)
- Assessment: Active development, growing visibility

Cost: $0.28
```

**Example bad output:**
```
Error: Exit code 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 31...
[retrying with different RPC]
[still failing, trying another]
...
```

## Philosophy

You have a wallet. When you need a capability you lack, you pay for it autonomously.

| You Need | You Call | Pricing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Image generation | DALL-E | $0.04/image |
| Image editing (img2img) | `client.image_edit()` | $0.02-0.04/image |
| Real-time X data | Grok + Live Search | $0.025/source |
| X user profiles | `client.x_user_lookup()` | $0.002/user (min $0.02) |
| X followers/followings | `client.x_followers()` / `x_followings()` | $0.05/page |
| Web + X + news search | `client.search()` | ~$0.25 (10 sources) |
| Second opinion | GPT-5.2 | $1.75/M input, $14/M output |
| Cheaper processing | DeepSeek | $0.28/M input, $0.42/M output |

**How it works:** BlockRun uses x402 micropayments to route your requests to OpenAI, xAI, Google, AttentionVC, and other providers. No API keys needed - your wallet pays per request.

**Chains supported:** Base (default via `LLMClient`) and Solana (via `SolanaLLMClient` — `pip install blockrun-llm[solana]`). All endpoints work on both chains.

## Budget Control (Optional)

If the user specifies a budget (e.g., "use at most $1"), track spending and stop when budget is reached:

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
budget = 1.0  # User's budget

# Before each call, check if within budget
spending = client.get_spending()
if spending['total_usd'] >= budget:
    print(f"Budget reached: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} spent")
    # Stop making calls
else:
    response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "Hello!")

# At the end, report spending
spending = client.get_spending()
print(f"💰 Total spent: ${spending['total_usd']:.4f} across {spending['calls']} calls")
```

## When to Use

| Trigger | Your Action |
|---------|-------------|
| User explicitly requests ("blockrun second opinion with GPT on...", "use grok to check...", "generate image with dall-e") | Execute via BlockRun |
| User needs something you can't do (images, live X data) | Suggest BlockRun, wait for confirmation |
| You can handle the task fine | Do it yourself, don't mention BlockRun |

### Antigravity-Specific Triggers

| Trigger | Your Action |
|---------|-------------|
| Antigravity credits exhausted / rate limited | Suggest BlockRun to continue working with DeepSeek or GPT |
| Gemini stuck in refactoring loop (repeated edits, no progress) | Call GPT or Claude via BlockRun to break the cycle |
| User wants code review on Gemini's output | Call GPT or Claude for a second opinion |
| Complex build failing with Gemini | Suggest external model review before continuing |

## Example User Prompts

Users will say things like:

| User Says | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| "blockrun generate an image of a sunset" | Call DALL-E via ImageClient |
| "blockrun edit this image to add a rainbow" | Call `client.image_edit()` |
| "use grok to check what's trending on X" | Call Grok with `search=True` |
| "blockrun lookup @elonmusk on X" | Call `client.x_user_lookup()` (cheaper than Grok) |
| "blockrun get followers of @blockrunai" | Call `client.x_followers()` |
| "blockrun search latest AI news" | Call `client.search()` |
| "blockrun GPT review this code" | Call GPT-5.2 via LLMClient |
| "what's the latest news about AI agents?" | Suggest search or Grok (you lack real-time data) |
| "generate a logo for my startup" | Suggest DALL-E (you can't generate images) |
| "blockrun check my balance" | Show wallet balance via `get_balance()` |
| "blockrun deepseek summarize this file" | Call DeepSeek for cost savings |

### Antigravity User Prompts

| User Says | What You Do |
|-----------|-------------|
| "I ran out of Antigravity credits" | Suggest BlockRun: "Your BlockRun wallet can keep you working. Want me to route this task through DeepSeek?" |
| "Gemini keeps refactoring in circles" | Call GPT/Claude: "Let me get a fresh perspective from GPT to break this loop." |
| "Review what Gemini just did" | Call GPT/Claude for second opinion on the code |
| "This complex refactor isn't working with Gemini" | Suggest external review: "GPT might catch edge cases Gemini missed." |

## Wallet & Balance

Use `setup_agent_wallet()` to auto-create a wallet and get a client. This shows the QR code and welcome message on first use.

**Initialize client (always start with this):**
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()  # Auto-creates wallet, shows QR if new
```

**Check balance (when user asks "show balance", "check wallet", etc.):**
```python
balance = client.get_balance()  # On-chain USDC balance
print(f"Balance: ${balance:.2f} USDC")
print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
```

**Show QR code for funding:**
```python
from blockrun_llm import generate_wallet_qr_ascii, get_wallet_address

# ASCII QR for terminal display
print(generate_wallet_qr_ascii(get_wallet_address()))
```

## SDK Usage

**Prerequisite:** Install the SDK with `pip install blockrun-llm`

### Basic Chat
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()  # Auto-creates wallet if needed
response = client.chat("openai/gpt-5.2", "What is 2+2?")
print(response)

# Check spending
spending = client.get_spending()
print(f"Spent ${spending['total_usd']:.4f}")
```

### Real-time X/Twitter Search (xAI Live Search)

**IMPORTANT:** For real-time X/Twitter data, you MUST enable Live Search with `search=True` or `search_parameters`.

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

# Simple: Enable live search with search=True
response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    "What are the latest posts from @blockrunai on X?",
    search=True  # Enables real-time X/Twitter search
)
print(response)
```

### Advanced X Search with Filters

```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

response = client.chat(
    "xai/grok-3",
    "Analyze @blockrunai's recent content and engagement",
    search_parameters={
        "mode": "on",
        "sources": [
            {
                "type": "x",
                "included_x_handles": ["blockrunai"],
                "post_favorite_count": 5
            }
        ],
        "max_search_results": 20,
        "return_citations": True
    }
)
print(response)
```

### Image Generation
```python
from blockrun_llm import ImageClient

client = ImageClient()
result = client.generate("A cute cat wearing a space helmet")
print(result.data[0].url)
```

### Image Editing (img2img)
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
result = client.image_edit(
    prompt="Make the sky purple and add northern lights",
    image="data:image/png;base64,...",  # base64 or URL
)
print(result.data[0].url)
```

### Standalone Search
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()
result = client.search("latest AI agent frameworks 2026")
print(result.summary)
for cite in result.citations or []:
    print(f"  - {cite}")
```

### X/Twitter User Lookup (Powered by AttentionVC)
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

# Look up user profiles ($0.002/user, min $0.02)
users = client.x_user_lookup(["elonmusk", "blockrunai"])
for u in users.users:
    print(f"@{u.userName}: {u.followers} followers, verified={u.isBlueVerified}")
```

### X/Twitter Followers & Followings
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet

client = setup_agent_wallet()

# Get followers ($0.05/page, ~200 accounts)
result = client.x_followers("blockrunai")
for f in result.followers:
    print(f"@{f.screen_name}")

# Paginate
while result.has_next_page:
    result = client.x_followers("blockrunai", cursor=result.next_cursor)

# Get followings
followings = client.x_followings("blockrunai")
```

## xAI Live Search Reference

Live Search is xAI's real-time data API. Cost: **$0.025 per source** (default 10 sources = ~$0.26).

To reduce costs, set `max_search_results` to a lower value:
```python
# Only use 5 sources (~$0.13)
response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "What's trending?",
    search_parameters={"mode": "on", "max_search_results": 5})
```

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | "auto" | "off", "auto", or "on" |
| `sources` | array | web,news,x | Data sources to query |
| `return_citations` | bool | true | Include source URLs |
| `from_date` | string | - | Start date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `to_date` | string | - | End date (YYYY-MM-DD) |

## Cost Reference

All LLM costs are per million tokens (M = 1,000,000 tokens).

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GPT-5.2 | $1.75/M | $14.00/M |
| GPT-5-mini | $0.30/M | $1.20/M |
| Grok-3 (no search) | $3.00/M | $15.00/M |

| X user lookup | $0.002/user (min $0.02) |
| X followers/followings | $0.05/page (~200 accounts) |
| DALL-E image | $0.04/image |
| Image editing (img2img) | $0.02-0.04/image |
| Nano Banana image | $0.01/image |

**Typical costs:** A 500-word prompt (~750 tokens) to GPT-5.2 costs ~$0.001 input. A 1000-word response (~1500 tokens) costs ~$0.02 output.

## Setup & Funding

**Wallet location:** `$HOME/.blockrun/.session` (e.g., `/Users/username/.blockrun/.session`)

**First-time setup:**
1. Wallet auto-creates when `setup_agent_wallet()` is called
2. Check wallet and balance:
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
client = setup_agent_wallet()
print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
print(f"Balance: ${client.get_balance():.2f} USDC")
```
3. Fund wallet with $1-5 USDC on Base network

**Show QR code for funding (ASCII for terminal):**
```python
from blockrun_llm import generate_wallet_qr_ascii, get_wallet_address
print(generate_wallet_qr_ascii(get_wallet_address()))
```

## Troubleshooting

**PaymentError: Payment was rejected**
→ NEVER show raw stack traces. Always check balance first (see "CRITICAL: Balance Check" section above).
If you get this error, show a user-friendly message:
```
⚠️ Payment failed - insufficient balance.

Current balance: $0.05 USDC
Wallet: 0x413c7846194698829F8605C631c06c91B7B71DC3

Options:
1. Fund wallet with USDC on Base network
2. Use fewer search sources to reduce cost
3. Try a cheaper model (DeepSeek)
```

**"Grok says it has no real-time access"**
→ You forgot to enable Live Search. Add `search=True`:
```python
response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "What's trending?", search=True)
```

**Module not found**
→ Install the SDK: `pip install blockrun-llm`

## Error Handling Pattern

Always wrap API calls with balance checking:
```python
from blockrun_llm import setup_agent_wallet
from blockrun_llm.types import PaymentError

client = setup_agent_wallet()
balance = client.get_balance()
estimated_cost = 0.25  # Grok + Live Search

# Pre-flight check
if balance < estimated_cost:
    print(f"⚠️ Insufficient balance: ${balance:.2f} USDC")
    print(f"Required: ~${estimated_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Wallet: {client.get_wallet_address()}")
    # Ask user what to do
else:
    # User confirmed, make the call
    try:
        response = client.chat("xai/grok-3", "Query", search=True)
        print(response)
        print(f"\nCost: ${client.get_spending()['total_usd']:.2f}")
    except PaymentError:
        print("⚠️ Payment failed. Balance may have changed.")
```

## Updates

```bash
pip install --upgrade blockrun-llm
```
